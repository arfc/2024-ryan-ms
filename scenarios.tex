In this work we explore the deployment of advanced reactors in the future energy landscape of the \gls{usa}. As the landscape evolves, compounding factors will drive actual deployment of these reactors in ways this work does not capture. The value of energy system modeling, and this type of transition scenario, is to understand the implications of deployment compared with and measured relatively to business as usual cases with similar approximations.

We use this chapter to explore the deployment schemes we have implemented---outlined in Table \ref{tab:deployment_schemes}---, and the demand growth scenarios we have considered---outlined in Table \ref{tab:demand_scenarios}. We will also discuss two additional deployment schemes that were implemented, but not incorporated as they are more useful for problems not considered herein.

\section{Greedy Deployment}
% describe the algorithm in detail
In this deployment scheme, the largest reactor is deployed first until another
deployment of that reactor would exceed the demand. Then the next largest
reactor is deployed in the same pattern until the next deployment of the
smallest reactor would exceed the demand. This scheme is not a proxy for
strategic decisions by individual actors, it merely meets the demand in a
roughly efficient manner.

\section{Random Deployment}
% describe the algorithm in detail

% what are the realistic and the unrealistic parts
Advanced reactor concepts, like the ones outlined in this work, are often designed for a different use-cases. ((((((((((((cite))))))))))))


The deployment of these reactors is a complex problem that requires a nuanced
understanding of the energy market, the regulatory environment, the intended
use of the technology, and the technical capabilities of the reactor. This
random deployment is a proxy for the complexity of the real-world deployment
problem, but does not include the nuance of future user needs, which will drive
the strategic decisions that utilities and rate payers behind the meter make in
their reactor choices.

This deployment scheme has the potential to capture some of the complexities in
overall market development, but the extent that these details are captured is
not explored in this work. %%% Should I? I'm not sure how long this would take to do, maybe something with ORSAGE?

\section{Considered Deployment Schemes}

In addition to the deployment schemes outlined above, we also considered a few other deployment schemes that were not included in the final analysis. These schemes were considered for their potential to capture the complexity of the deployment problem, but were ultimately not included due to the egregious nature of approximation required to make the implementation or the lack of a clear benefit over the other schemes.

\subsection{Capped Deployment}
% describe the algorithm in detail
In this scheme, there is a constant limit placed on the number of a specific reactor that can be deployed at any given time step. This is a simple way to model aggregate supply chain constrains that could limit vendors from deploying reactors freely. With the right constraints, this scheme would better succeed at roughly incorporating the limits of a workforce over a short to medium time scale. As workforce constraints are outside the scope of this work, this scheme was implemented but not incorporated in this work.

To use this deployment scheme, a user needs some idea of the supply chain constraints that will limit the deployment of the reactors they are deploying. In Figure \ref{fig:cap_diagram}, we illustrate the defining steps of the capped deployment scheme. The main loop in the logic is consistent with the greedy deployment scheme, but adds a check to see if the current deployment exceeds the limit on that model. If it does, the reactor is removed from the list of reactors to be deployed in that time step.

\end{figure}

% what are the realistic and the unrealistic parts
The realism of this deployment scheme mirrors some elements of the pre-determined distribution (this is a flat distribution after all), but the cap is a less granular way to account for supply chain constraints

% when does it over or under perform

\section{Pre-Determined Distribution Deployment}
% describe the algorithm in detail
This deployment scheme allows users to incorporate the projections and
commitments of rate payers and utilities by setting a distribution over the
time of the simulation. In this scheme the distribution serves as a cap to the
number of reactors deployed in a time step, and reactors are preferentially
deployed first to meet those caps. After that has been completed, the remaining
reactors without caps are deployed to meet the demand. In this way, we are able
to incorporate knowledge of supply chain constraints for specific technologies
without having to model the supply chain in detail.
% would be great to find some sources for this, and see what the literature says
