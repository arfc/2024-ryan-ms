I would like to thank Prof. Madicken Munk, who mentored me as a student and who
constantly inspires me to think big and find the impact in my work. Relatedly,
I would like to thank Prof. Kathryn Huff, who has been a mentor to me at every
step of my collegiate education and who shows me how to be a happy warrior.

I want to thank my fellow graduate students and the members of
\gls{arfc}; particularly Dr. Amanda Bachmann, Sam Dotson, Nataly Panczyk, Olek
Yardas, Zo\"{e} Richter, Dr. Gwendolyn Chee, Dr. Sun Myung Park, Rhys
MacMillian, and Ceser Zambrano. I would like to especially thank Luke Seifert
for his assistance in running the Serpent simulations in this thesis.

Throughout the years, I have learned much from my group mates, advisors, and
mentors, but I would be remiss not to acknowledge that I went to the school of
open source and learned much from countless developers who work openly to
better science. Particularly the \cyclus community, especially Prof. Paul P.H.
Wilson, Dr. Katie Mummah, Jin Whan Bae, and Dr. Eva Davidson.

I owe many thanks to my parents, brother, grandparents, family, partner, and
friends who have reminded me---sometimes to my chagrin---that life keeps going
outside the walls of my office. To my cousin Matthew, I can not wait to explain
this part of my life to you someday when we are reunited because I know you
will have questions.
