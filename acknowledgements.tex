I would like to thank Prof. Madicken Munk, who introduced me into
the nuclear community as a newly minted graduate student and who inspires
constantly with her intelligence and warmth.

I would like to thank Prof. Kathryn Huff, who has been a mentor and advisor to
me at every step of my collegiate education and who

I would like to thank my fellow graduate students, and the members of
\gls{arfc} especially Amanda Bachmann, Sam Dotson, Nataly Panczyk, Olek Yardas,
ZoÃ« Richter, Luke Seifert, Gwendolyn Chee, Sun Myung Park, and Rhys MacMillian.

I learned much from my group mates, advisors, and mentors, but would be
remiss to not acknowledge that I went to the school of open source and
learned much from countless developers who work openly to better science. In
particular the \cyclus community, especially Prof. Paul P.H. Wilson, Jin Whan
Bae, and Dr. Eva Davidson--the latter two I have had the pleasure of working
for one summer during my time as a student, and all of my hackathons to date
have been with Prof. Wilson and his students.

I owe many thanks to my parents, brother, grandparents, family, partner, and
friends who have reminded me that life keeps going outside the walls of my
office. To my cousin Matthew, I can not wait to explain this part of my life to
you someday when we are reunited.
