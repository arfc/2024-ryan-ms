% Provide an introduction to the literature review. Explain the scope of the
% review.

Provide a summary of the key points discussed in the literature review. Highlight the relevance of the reviewed literature to your research.


\section{Transition Scenarios}

% Discuss the theoretical framework and key concepts that underpin the research.

As there are various definitions for each class of enrichment, we will use the following for the purposes of this work:

\begin{table}[htbp]
   \centering
   \caption{Enrichment levels and their ranges.}
   \label{tab:enrichment_levels}
   \begin{tabular}{c c}
      \hline
      \textbf{Enrichment Level} & \textbf{Range [\%  $^{235}$U]} \\
      \hline
      natural uranium & < 0.711 \\
      \gls{leu} & 0.711-5 \\
      \gls{leu+} & 5-10 \\
      \gls{haleu} & 10-20 \\
      \gls{heu} & $\geq$ 20  \\
      \hline
   \end{tabular}
\end{table}


% Identify gaps or limitations in the existing literature. Discuss areas where further research is needed.
