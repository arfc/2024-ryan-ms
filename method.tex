In this section, we will discuss the transition scenarios for the deployment of new nuclear reactors in the \gls{usa} and the reactor models used in this work. We will also discuss the theoretical framework and key concepts that underpin the research, and the results for each deployment scheme.

\section{Transition Scenarios}
\label{sec:transition_scenarios}
% Discuss the theoretical framework and key concepts that underpin the research.

Through the transition scenarios, we aim to explore the deployment of advanced reactors in the \gls{usa} and the implications of transitioning from the current fleet to incorporate advanced reactor technologies not currently deployed. We have chosen to focus on a few key metrics: \gls{swu}, energy output, mass of fuel, and reactor deployment to illustrate these scenarios in comparison with a business-as-usual case. This work introduces fuel cycle models for advanced reactors inclusive of multiple fuel enrichments and forms, and a novel deployment scheme that considers the demand growth and reactor availability.


% Identify gaps or limitations in the existing literature. Discuss areas where further research is needed.
