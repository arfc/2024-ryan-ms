\subsection{Cyclus and SWU}
Cyclus is an agent-based \gls{nfc} simulator that is incredibly versatile,
one of the initial core developers (Professor Katy Huff) likes to say
that, "Cyclus can be used to model any process from making a
grilled-cheese to international nuclear fuel cycles." The software
achieves this versatility through a series of generic archetypes that are
primarily transaction based. Over the years, the user community and
developers have created a litany of nuclear specific archetypes for
everything from proliferation assessment to fuel burnup.

We have referenced \gls{swu} several times now without explaining how the
measure is derived, so we will rectify that now. \gls{swu}, or Separative
Work Units, is a ubiquitous measure of effort that goes into producing
nuclear fuel. It is simplified as:
\begin{align}
    SWU&= Q(C_pâˆ’C_f)
    \intertext{Where:}
    SWU&= \mbox{Separative Work Units [kgSWU]}\nonumber\\
    Q&= \mbox{ Quantity of material processed [kg]}\nonumber\\
    C_p&=\mbox{ Enrichment level of the product [$\%$]}\nonumber\\
    C_f&= \mbox{ Enrichment level of the feed [$\%$].}\nonumber
\end{align}
