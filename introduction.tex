While the world grapples with the effects of climate change, the demand for clean and firm energy continues to increase. Utilities and decision-makers face rising energy demands of machine learning and data center companies, which require a constant and reliable energy source. The escalation of data center demand has led the \gls{eia} to forego publishing its annual energy outlook report in 2023 as it evaluates its models under emergent market pressures \cite{eia_annual_outlook_canceled_2023}. New nuclear reactors---designed to be more efficient, flexible, and resilient than the reactors that have come before them---can provide clean, firm energy to meet these demands.

Since 1959, the \gls{usa} has commercially operated large \gls{lwr} designs at
nuclear power plants. These reactors use light water as a coolant and moderator
and can be categorized as either \glspl{pwr} or \glspl{bwr}. As shown in Figure
\ref{fig:online_lwr_cap_2024}, the \gls{lwr} fleet in the \gls{usa} expanded power capacity over roughly 20 years before achieving just over 99 GWe in
1990 and remained roughly constant in the years since then. With the recent
connection of Vogtle Units 3 and 4 to the grid, the \gls{usa} has seen the
first new \gls{lwr} units come online in 8 years--following the completion of
Watts Bar-2 in 2016.

According to the \gls{eia}, nuclear power plants produced 18\% of utility-scale
electricity generation in 2023 \cite{eia_elec_gen_2024}, meaning nuclear energy was 46.5\% of total clean energy generation and the largest clean energy source in the country. The last license in the fleet will now expire in 2063 following
the completion of Vogtle Unit 4; however, to meet our growing energy demands, the \gls{usa} will need to replace and expand the current fleet as it retires over that time; deploying new reactors at a rate that has not been seen since the 1970s. The \gls{doe} has published a liftoff report on the potential for
nuclear energy to meet future demands and has outlined myriad scenarios that could lead to a 100\% clean energy future by 2050
\cite{julie_liftoff_pathways_2024}. One of the striking takeaways from the
liftoff report is the potential  for tripling nuclear energy demand by 2050
due to new capacity demand, the retirement of fossil fuels, electrification of our economy, and other behind-the-meter applications of nuclear technologies. The potential \gls{doe} outlines is not without its challenges; the \gls{eia} 2023 Domestic Uranium Production Report highlights the decrease in uranium
concentrate production in the \gls{usa} and the number of fuel cycle facilities
that are dormant or have been decommissioned \cite{eia_uranium_statistics_2023}.

Despite these deployment challenges, the \gls{doe} liftoff report asserts that
high-value propositions in low land use, firm energy generation, direct heat
applications, local economic benefits, and the low transmission build-out
associated with nuclear energy make it a compelling choice. Some of these
benefits can be reflected in the 73\% increase in uranium production workers
from 2022 to 2023, the 4x increase in exploration of uranium resources, and a
\$20 million increase in resource investment \cite{eia_uranium_statistics_2023}
---the private sector is starting to move on the value proposition of nuclear energy.

The current fleet of \glspl{lwr} has been the backbone of the commercial nuclear
industry, but the industry is on the precipice of a different generation of
reactor technologies. The fleet of \glspl{lwr} uses a ceramic uranium-oxide fuel
that is enriched to 3-5\% $^{235}$U, but there is a panoply of advanced reactor
designs at various stages of deployment using our decades of
experience with creating nuclear energy. These reactors vary in size from large
gigawatt-scale reactors to smaller reactors that can fit on the back of a
truck. The design space is vast, but one innovation that has been a focus of
the nuclear industry is the \gls{triso} fuel particle. This fuel particle is a small sphere of uranium fuel coated in carbon and silicon carbide layers. \gls{triso} is designed to be more robust than traditional fuel and used in various reactor designs that require higher enrichments of $^{235}$U into \gls{haleu} territory (5-20\%).

The \gls{nfc} describes the steps nuclear fuel goes through
in its life cycle. In Figure \ref{fig:once-through}, we have outlined a
simple \textit{once-through} fuel cycle (so-called because the fuel goes through
the cycle once in its lifetime). The fuel cycle begins with mining uranium ore,
typically from uraninite or pitchblende deposits. Then, the ore must be milled
and refined into yellowcake, which can then be converted into uranium
hexafluoride. To power the reactors in the \gls{usa}, the uranium hexafluoride
is then enriched to the desired percentage of $^{235}$U and converted
into uranium dioxide. Reactor operators receive the fuel in rods after it has
been fabricated into fuel pellets from uranium dioxide. Upon receiving the
fuel, workers load the rods into the reactor to generate heat. The heat
generates steam, which drives a turbine and generates electricity. After years
of operation, workers remove the used fuel from the reactor and store it in a
spent fuel pool. After cooling, transporters move the used
fuel to dry cask storage, where it will remain until policymakers act to enable
a long-term solution.

\end{figure}

Although we have linearly presented them, these steps are interwoven with
multilateral relationships and long-term purchasing agreements that complicate
the establishment of new supply chains. Consequently, the availability of
services at each step in the fuel cycle is difficult to model; this is where we
use the \cyclus \cite{huff_cyclus_intro_2016} tool. \cyclus is a
nuclear fuel cycle simulator that allows users to model the material movement between facilities in discrete-event simulations. These facilities
are run by agents that make decisions and interact with other agents. Because
\cyclus is designed to be technology agnostic, we can use it to model a variety
of fuel cycles and reactor types--although it is not primarily a physics code,
and coupling it with physics codes can be necessary for some problems.

Partners in industry, academia, and government are building the body of
literature surrounding \gls{triso} fuel cycles. This work is a timely
evaluation of various energy-demand scenarios and an optimization of the
deployment of advanced reactors building off of the method established by
Bachmann et al. \cite{bachmann_enrichment_2021} for \gls{haleu} fuel,
incorporating the staggered enrichment demand that advanced reactor
companies could explore as the \gls{haleu} supply chain
develops. We seek to understand the deployment of advanced reactors in the
\gls{usa} and the implications of the fuel cycle on the deployment of these
reactors, as some designs adopt a staggered enrichment demand for various
\gls{triso} fuels. We have chosen to focus on \gls{swu},
energy output, mass of fuel, and reactor deployment to understand
the performance of each deployment scenario. In
service of this goal, we will also examine the computational efficiency of the
\gls{dre} in \cyclus to contribute to a robust tool for future analysis.
